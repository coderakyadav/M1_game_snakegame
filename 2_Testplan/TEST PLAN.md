Testing is the major control measure used during software development. Its basic function is to detect errors in the software.

This implies that testing not only, has to uncover errors introduced during coding, but also errors introduced during previous phase. Thus the goal of testing is to uncover the requirements, design and coding errors in the programs. Softer testing the outputs of my project are as follows:
