# SNAKE GAME

Problem Statement

As we see that in today's world people miss ancient mobile games of which one we have choose is Snake game. So i decided to build a Snake game which will be

robust and fast. In this way people can fulfil their wish to play such games through my application which is developed in one of the most robust language i.e. C.


## INTRODUCTION



The game called "Snake" or "Snake Game" typically involve the player controlling a line or snake, there is no official version of the game, so gameplay varies. The most common version of the game involves the snake or line eating items which make it longer, with the objective being to avoid running into a border or the snake itself for as long as possible.

The player loses when the snake either runs into a border or its own body.
Because of this, the game becomes more difficult as it goes on, due to the
growth of the snake.Nokia has installed the "Snake Game" on many of its phones. The game is also available on several websites, including YouTube, which allows viewers to play the game while a video loads


## CONCLUSION



This Project in C language of Snake Game is a simple console application with very simple graphics. In this project, you can play the popular "Snake Game" just like you played it elsewhere. You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake.

Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the
snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score. It isn't the world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with a relatively simple C program, and perhaps the
basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting
games of your own.


## Features
