# SYSTEM DESIGN

Then we began with the design phase of the system. System design is a solution, a “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here we use Flowchart to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.
